### Overview

This project leverages Clinical Natural Language Technology to enhance healthcare diagnostics and documentation. By integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and Computer Vision, this project provides a streamlined solution for summarizing clinical notes and automating data extraction.

### Features

- **Text Summarization**: Utilizes NLP models to summarize clinical text input.
- **File Upload**: Allows users to upload text files for summarization.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for backend development.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating interactive web applications.
- **Transformers**: Library from Hugging Face for NLP models.
- **OCR Libraries**: For text extraction from uploaded files.
