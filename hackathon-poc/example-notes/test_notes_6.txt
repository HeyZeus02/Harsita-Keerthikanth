Session Summary                          Client abruptly left a planned session that occurred earlier today and
Brief Description of this session and    stated “this is a waste of time, I am giving up” Client has a history of
how it relates to treatment goals, and   suicide attempts (most recent 3 months ago) and has reported having
the clients symptoms and impact on       access to means that she has previously used (her mom’s insulin). Client is
functioning                              experiencing a life stressor (job loss) that has triggered suicidal intent in
                                         client in the past. Therapist attempted to reach out to client by email and
                                         phone to assess for suicidality; client did not respond to either. Therapist
                                         reached out to client’s emergency contact (client’s mother) by phone as
                                         previously agreed upon in client’s safety plan for situations of potential
                                         client endangerment. Therapist coordinated with client’s emergency
                                         contact to secure supply of insulin in an inaccessible location, and
                                         encourage client to speak to therapist over the phone. Client was
                                         amenable to speaking to therapist and explained that her phone was on
                                         silent. Client endorsed passive suicidality and access to means, but denied
                                         intent. Client’s mother was present for part of the call and reported that
                                         some of her insulin was missing. Client eventually admitted to talking
                                         some and storing it in her mini fridge in her room. Client returned the
                                         insulin to her mom and mom confirmed that none was used and the
                                         correct amount was present.

Clinical Interventions                   C-SSRS assessment, reviewed safety plan, coordinated crisis intervention
                                         for voluntary evaluation for in-patient hospitalization

Clients response to interventions        Client eventually agreed to a voluntary hospital evaluation, and client’s
                                         mom agreed to accompany client to the hospital. Therapist remained on
                                         the phone with client until client’s mom confirmed she arrived at the
                                         hospital and was safely linked to hospital staff. Therapist briefly provided
                                         collateral information to hospital intake staff re: client’s risk factors (time
                                         not included in note). Client’s mom agreed to put insulin in a locked
                                         location from now on.
