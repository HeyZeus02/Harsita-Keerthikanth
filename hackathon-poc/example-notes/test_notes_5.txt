how it relates to treatment goals, and   difficulty breathing, tremors, and crying at least 3 days per week in the

functioning                              negative impact on her academic performance. She reports experiencing
                                         the most panic when she is called on to answer problems, which occurred
                                         last week. She indicates that when the teacher called on her she began to
                                         stutter, heart rate increased and she began to shake, cry and ran out of
                                         the class. Since this class on Monday, She has continued to worry that she
                                         will be called on or that her peers are judging her, which causes her to not
                                         focus on her work. Client was able to identify what thoughts triggered her
                                         panic attack this week. Counselor introduced thought distortions to client
                                         and explained automatic thoughts. Counselor modeled reframing. Client
                                         denied any ideations of suicidal, homicidal, or self-injurious behavior.

                                         distortions. She indicated a belief that her peers believe that she is not
                                         smart and are judging her.
